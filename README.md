# Library Reservation System

Group project - Managing software projects

# Synopsis 

Library provides the university’s students with resources for study or research, such as textbooks. We currently use a paper-based system to keep track of students’ reservation and borrowing activities. We are in need of a new online reservation system for our books as not only have some students stolen our books and not returned them, but we’ve also been accidentally allowing multiple students to reserve the same book, which has led to a lot of conflict within the reservation system. We are in need of a new online web application that can help us keep a track of who has reserved and borrowed what, and enable students to reserve books from the Library. This online system must feature a graphical user interface, while delivering full reservation functionality with the ability to inform students when the return dates on their borrowed books are due by sending them reminders.

# Deliverables and schedule

A website with a front end coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a backend consisting purely of PHP with 2 SQL databases for books and student accounts respectively.
The website shall track the current status of books, if they’re available, reserved or unavailable and if a book has been returned within its due date (2 weeks).
Staff will be notified when a book has been reserved through the system.
